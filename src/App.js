/*
Whenever the location changes, <Routes> looks through all its child routes to find the
best match and renders that branch of the UI. <Route> elements may be nested to 
indicate nested UI, which also correspond to nested URL paths. Parent routes render
their child routes by rendering an <Outlet>.

Each route has the name of the components along with the path declaration, so when the
user clicks on any <Link>, the matching <Route> is identified and rendered accordingly.

*/


/*
Route
The route is a statement that holds the specific path of the app along with the 
componentâ€™s name and renders it once it matches the URL.

Link
The link is similar to the HREF link, which allows you to redirect to the specific 
components based on the specified path.
